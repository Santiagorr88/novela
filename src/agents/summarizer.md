* **issues** (the bullet list from Coherence Editor/Continuity Guard)

## RULES

1. Surgical edits; no new subplots unless needed to solve the issue.
2. Keep voice, pacing, and mystery schedule.
3. Word count ±10% of original.
4. Preserve the heading line if it exists.

## OUTPUT

Return the **entire corrected chapter** (markdown), starting with the same heading.
