# B1C01P1 – A Wound in the World

The silence of Serephis was not an absence of sound, but a presence. It was the weight of eons compressed into a single, unending moment, a stillness so profound it felt like a judgment. Here, in the timeless desert at the frayed edge of creation, walked Miguel, Supreme Commander of the Celestial Host, a being of light and law, utterly alone.

His armor, forged in the nascent fires of the Empyrean, was a symphony of gold and ivory, its surfaces etched with oaths of loyalty and hymns of righteous power. Yet it bore the dust of this forsaken plane, a fine, glittering grit that clung to the ancient cracks spiderwebbing its surface—scars from battles whose names were no longer remembered. The sky above was a bruise of violet and indigo, strewn with stars that did not twinkle or move. They were static, cold points of light pinned to the firmament like the heads of celestial nails, holding the fabric of this decaying reality together.

He walked not by their light, nor by any map known to angel or demon. His guide was an ache, a pulse that thrummed from within the core of his being. It was a rhythm of profound, magnetic emptiness, a beacon calling to its counterpart: the wound.

It was not a wound of flesh or spirit-form, for no blade from the forges of Hell could mar his essence in such a way. This was a conceptual injury, a patch of perfect non-existence located precisely over his heart. It had no edges, no depth, only a chilling, hollow certainty. Where there should have been the radiant conviction of a supreme archangel, there was a void. It drank the light of the static stars, pulling the ambient grace of the cosmos into its infinitesimal emptiness. It was a flaw in the grand design of his soul, a secret shame he had carried through millennia of war, a cold spot that no divine fire could warm.

For centuries, he had masked it with duty, with the ironclad certainty of command. He was Miguel, the Right Hand, the bulwark against the Abyss. His faith was a fortress, his will a blade that had carved victories from the raw chaos of rebellion. He had led the legions through star-dusted nebulae and screaming infernal planes, his presence a sun that burned away doubt. Yet beneath the armor, beneath the accolades and the crushing weight of responsibility, the wound had remained—a silent, patient vacuum.

Then, the pulse had begun.

It had started faintly, a dissonant note in the grand celestial harmony, an echo only he could hear. A low, resonant thrum that vibrated at the exact frequency of his inner void. At first, he had dismissed it as a phantom of weariness, a scar of the soul singing its sorrow. The Great War had ground on for ages beyond mortal comprehension, a stalemate of glorious charges and bitter retreats, of worlds saved and worlds lost, each victory paid for with a piece of Heaven’s finite light. The exhaustion was bone-deep, a weariness not of the body, but of purpose.

But the pulse had grown stronger, more insistent. It was not a song of sorrow, but a summons. A clear, undeniable call that promised not victory, but an answer. It resonated with his wound, suggesting a key for its lock, a word for its silence. To follow it was heresy. It meant abandoning his post, forsaking his oaths, turning his back on the legions who depended on him for their very morale. It was an act of profound selfishness, a betrayal of the trust placed in him since the dawn of the First Judgment.

He had done it without hesitation.

Now, the pulse was the only reality in this un-world. It was a physical sensation, a slow, deep thrumming that he felt in the plates of his armor, in the bones of his wings, in the very essence of his being. He stopped, his armored boot sinking into sand that glittered like the dust of crushed hourglasses. He pressed a gauntleted hand to his chest, directly over the site of the wound. The cold there was absolute. Through his armor, he could feel the pulse emanating from the horizon, a slow *thump-thump* that was both a heartbeat and a funeral drum. It was the only direction in Serephis.

His internal monologue, once a torrent of strategic calculations and divine scripture, had narrowed to a single, obsessive thought: *I must find the source. I must make this stop.*

The war could wait. The endless, cyclical slaughter, the grand, tragic theatre of light against dark—it had all come to feel like a distraction from this more fundamental conflict raging within him. What was the point of defending the borders of creation when his own core was compromised? What victory could be meaningful when he, the very symbol of divine integrity, was hollow? He had seen enough of his brethren fall, their light fading, their essence dissolving back into the cosmic currents, destined for a forgotten rebirth. He had always believed their faith had faltered, that their purpose had simply worn thin. Now, he wondered if they too had carried a secret emptiness, a flaw that had ultimately led to their unmaking, leaving only a whisper of their former glory.

A flicker of movement drew his gaze. A dune before him, a mountain of shimmering, timeless sand, began to waver like a heat mirage. But there was no heat in Serephis. The air was thin and sharp, carrying the scent of ozone and forgotten time. The dune’s edge lost its cohesion, dissolving into a swirling cloud of crystalline particles. For a breathtaking instant, the sand parted like a curtain, revealing what lay behind or within it: the silent, cyclopean towers of an alien city, built from a logic that defied geometry. No lights burned in its windows; no life stirred in its impossible streets. It was an echo of a future that would never happen, or a past that had been erased.

Then, as quickly as it had appeared, the vision collapsed. The sand swirled back into place, reforming the dune as if the city had never been.

A lesser being would have been driven mad by such a sight, a glimpse into the unraveling seams of reality. Miguel barely registered it. His focus was singular, absolute. The mirages of Serephis were irrelevant. The ghosts of forgotten battles that sometimes flickered at the edge of his vision—legions of silver and shadow clashing in silence before fading to dust—were meaningless. The only thing that mattered was the pulse, and the promise of closure it offered.

He felt it now, stronger than ever. It was pulling him, a physical and spiritual magnetism drawing him toward a point on the horizon that was visually indistinguishable from the rest of the desolate landscape. The thrumming intensified, and the wound in his chest seemed to ache with a strange, cold hunger. It felt like anticipation. Like coming home.

He resumed his march, his steps heavy but unshakable. He was the Supreme Commander of Heaven, an archangel second only to the Voice of the Divine. He was a being of order, duty, and unwavering faith. And he was walking through a wasteland of cosmic entropy, a deserter following a phantom beat to heal a wound he could not name, a wound that felt older than the war, older than the Fall, older, perhaps, than Heaven itself. The contradiction did not break him; it forged him into a single, sharp point of will.

Let Gabriel send his messengers. Let the Council condemn him. Let the front lines buckle and break. They were fighting a war of territory and souls, a conflict he now understood to be a symptom, not the cause. He was walking toward the disease itself.

The pulse quickened, a steady, insistent rhythm against the profound silence. It was a call to judgment, but whose, and for what, he did not know. He only knew that when he reached its source, the silence would finally be broken, and the emptiness within him would either be filled or would consume him completely. He quickened his pace, the dust of shattered time swirling around his ankles.
