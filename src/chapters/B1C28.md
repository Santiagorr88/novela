# B1C28 – The Echo of the Sword 

The sky was burning.  
It was no metaphor; it was fissure and living fire: bleeding cracks opened in the vault, and from them, angels wreathed in flames fell. The crash of broken thunder shook the earth while a rain of charred feathers blanketed the battlefield. It was the last day—not merely celestial, but final.

Michael descended amid the wreckage of the firmament.
The sword in his hand throbbed like a desperate heart; the Judgment that once pronounced sentences now screamed orders. His wings—radiant but torn—traced streaks of light. A fissure opened in his chest, yet the determination in his eyes remained unshaken.

"Not one step back!" he thundered, without losing breath.

To his right, Gabriel panted. His lance trembled; dust and luminous blood smeared his face.
"We endure," he said, spitting a spark of light, "until you do what you must."

Raphael, kneeling over a fallen angel, sealed his comrade's wound with a greenish glow.
"No funeral speeches," he threw at Gabriel with a half-laugh. "We’re still breathing."

They did not fight for victory; they fought for time. Time for Michael to find the impossible move, the final word, the note to tune a broken universe. Around them, battle was chaos—shattered banners, infernal howls. Smoke rose like accusing fingers; the lines between Heaven and Abyss blurred in blood and light.

A battalion of demons advanced in a wedge, armored in polished skulls. Camael intercepted them with the fury of a trapped lightning bolt: each blow from his sword Ramiel was a thunderclap that shattered both bone and will. Beside him, Sariel hunted the reincarnated—human souls who had awakened on the battlefield, their veil torn away too soon. One, a young girl with gray eyes, screamed a name she didn’t know she knew. Sariel froze her with Shadow and passed her to the healers before a demon could finish her.

A chorus of demonic voices chanted an inverted hymn. The air vibrated with forbidden words. Uriel raised his spear and, with a sharp gesture, lit sacred flames that silenced the chant. Half the singers disintegrated; the rest turned to smoke that screamed until vanishing.

Then, amid the flames, rose a silhouette sculpted from void: **Belial, Infernal Lord of Absolute Manipulation**. No introduction was needed; his mere presence distorted the air, as if space itself didn’t know how to shape around him. In his hand he bore a black spear, covered in runes that seemed to writhe when seen.

Michael frowned. Each time his sword clashed against that weapon, the spear absorbed the impact, and time itself contracted around the clash—like a held breath. Something in that vibration raised his feathers. It didn’t feel infernal. It felt ancient.

Belial smiled with cruel calm.
"Look at your army, Michael. There’s no faith left to hold them up."

Michael lowered his blade’s tip, just for a moment.
"Faith is not counted in bodies," he replied, lifting his sword with a twist. "It’s measured in the last breath."

"Then breathe deeply," Belial growled—and lunged.

The clash was pure cataclysm. The ground split, distant seas began to boil; entire mountains crumbled into dust. The sword’s light traced white arcs; the spear carved abysses that drained hope. Each time Michael struck, he felt an echo that was not his own. A broken melody. A memory that didn’t belong to him.

Gabriel led a lateral counterattack, coordinating exhausted squads with a single motion and the resonance of his voice.
"Hold the line! He needs space!"
His words echoed not just in ears, but in the chest of every fighter.

Raphael, fingers bloodied with light, healed three at a time, sweating radiance that evaporated upon hitting the floor. In a single glance, he looked toward Michael—as if knowing it would be his last view of him like this. His green eyes narrowed, a silent prayer forming on his lips.

Zadkiel rose just enough to see the field: he read guilt, delivered silent judgments. Each strike of his hammer Decretum fell upon demons whose sins were so heavy the earth opened to swallow them. But even he hesitated: for the first time, he saw a judgment that did not fulfill as expected. The cycle was bent.

The spear struck Michael’s chest again—ancient, impossible. A whisper brushed his mind—a voice laughing, another burning, another silent—and amid the chaos, he understood: that spear… did not belong here. Not in Belial’s hands. Not on this side of the war.

Belial seized the hesitation: he twisted the spear, slid it like a serpent, and drove it beneath Michael’s golden armor. The dark steel pierced his torso with a dull crunch. The archangel didn’t scream; he gritted his teeth, grabbed the shaft to keep it still… and smiled with serene pain.

"You won’t give me the fall," he whispered.

With his other hand, he drove the sword toward his enemy’s heart. But in the final blink, a demon commander—a creature in blind service to Belial—threw itself between them. The divine blade split him in two; his sacrifice exploded in a cloud of shadow that absorbed the strike.

Belial stepped back, wounded only in pride.
"Thank your servant," Michael gasped as the light composing him began to unravel. "Today, he saved you from nothingness."

The archangel’s radiance condensed, as if to speak a final word that could seal the breach—a word that might have stopped both armies, maybe rewritten the battle. But it never came: his body disintegrated in a white explosion that blinded both living and dead.

When clarity returned, only a crater of ash and utter silence remained. Michael’s sword had flown off, lost beyond the horizon. The void left by his absence felt physical—a vacuum that drew in noise and will.

The demons sensed it and retreated, not knowing why. Some dissolved in pure fear. The celestials, stunned, heard the echo of a leadership that was no more.

Gabriel, half-lame and feathers scorched, raised his voice:
"Retreat to the Temple! Now!"

It wasn’t a tactical order; it was a plea laced with love and mourning. The army obeyed like a single heartbeat.

MUSTERING HALL – TEMPLE OF SHATTERED LIGHT
The doors closed with a metallic groan, and tension fell over the vestibule like incandescent dust. The echo of defeat vibrated through the fractured walls; half-melted candles cast trembling shadows over exhausted faces.

Gabriel leaned the splintered banner against the altar and rubbed his blackened neck. He didn’t even try to smooth the scorched feathers of his wings. His fingers trembled—not from fear, but from the overwhelming absence of a weight that had stood beside him for millennia.

"Raphael," he murmured without turning, "how many are still untreated?"

"Too many," the healer replied, leaning on the stone table, fingers stained with dried light. "And that’s not counting those who only bleed inside."

Uriel paced in circles, dragging the tip of his spear across the marble. Golden sparks flared behind him.
"We can’t sit here licking our wounds," he growled. "If Belial returns with reinforcements—"

"He won’t return today," Camael interrupted, his voice deep. "He lost his most loyal shield. That’ll hurt him more than he admits."

Zadkiel approached, holding a charred manuscript. His eyes—usually unreadable—were bloodshot with concern.
"The cycle isn’t broken, but it’s bent. I don’t know how long it can hold."

Cassiel, leaning against a pillar, let out an incredulous snort:
"Is anyone going to say it? The Supreme Commander…"—he swallowed—"is gone."

A heavy silence. The sputter of a single candle dared to answer. Iophiel, from a corner, clutched her Memnon staff so tightly her knuckles looked like they’d tear.

Gabriel inhaled, as if every word cost him a wing.
"Michael will fall again into this world," he said. "And when he wakes, he won’t remember any of this. We must hold until then."

"Hold without his sword, too," Iophiel added from the shadows. "It’s lost on Earth. Maybe for centuries."

"Centuries?" murmured Elom from the back, his Nodo staff crackling with broken connections. "Our lines will break and mend a hundred times by then."

"We have no alternative," Zadkiel replied curtly. "If the cycle holds, he’ll return. If not…"—he didn’t finish. The hammer Decretum struck the ground with a sound like restrained judgment.

All eyes turned to Gabriel. He met them one by one, then nodded solemnly. He allowed himself a second to close his eyes—to remember the weight of a hand on his shoulder, Michael’s, countless times—and then he spoke.

"Then we’ll have to be his sword. For now."

No one cheered, but shoulders straightened. Raphael moved from the table and began assigning triage tasks; Uriel lit new watch braziers that smelled of incense and ozone. Zadkiel and Iophiel unrolled a battered map over broken stone, marking routes and shelters. Even Cassiel, still trembling, curled his fingers around his signal trumpet, eyes searching the echo of his own silent music.

In a corner, nearly invisible, Barachiel murmured prayers in forgotten tongues, sending messages to scattered squads. Anael approached the soul-wounded more than the physically hurt, leaving small sparks of pure emotion in their hands. Remiel, in silence, watched his own shadows dance on the wall—improbable futures flickering and fading with each blink.

At last, Gabriel raised the half-broken banner and planted it before the assembly.
"We will endure," he vowed, with a thread of voice that still echoed through the foundation. "We will endure… until his return."

No one contradicted him. And for one fleeting second, the trembling walls seemed to still, as if the temple itself—fractured but upright—whispered that something was still worth fighting for.

Later, as the hum of duties filled the hall, Gabriel withdrew to a side chapel. He let his back slide against a cracked column and allowed the pain—physical and spiritual—to flow through him. He closed his eyes and saw the spear again. That vibration. That ancient echo. He made a note in his mind:
Find out what that weapon is… and where it came from.

He pressed his forehead against the cold marble.
"Come back," he whispered into the void. "Or teach me to lead without you."

INTERLUDE: THE ECHO THAT REMAINS
Days later, the Temple of Shattered Light still stood by sheer will. Outside, the sky continued fracturing and healing in strange cycles. Inside, strategies, provisions, and the names of the fallen were written and crossed out on ever-more fragile scrolls.

Iophiel gathered fragments of prophecy, scattered among codices that survived the first fire. She found a verse she didn’t recall reading before:
“When the sword falls, the echo is not silence—it is a sign.”
She brought it to Zadkiel, who read it without frowning, but with his hammer heavy in hand.

"A sign of what?" he asked, flatly.
"I don’t know," Iophiel replied, her voice like sliding parchment. "Maybe that someone else heard… or will."

While healing, Raphael once again touched the empty space where Michael’s presence used to be. No trace remained—but in his healer’s hands, he felt a distant heartbeat. Not in the heavens. Somewhere else.

DECADES LATER – UNKNOWN PLACE
The briny air drifted in from the horizon like a cool sigh, the prelude to a day that had yet to decide whether to yield to the sun or the low clouds veiling the sky. A murmur of seagulls occasionally pierced the steady hum of the tide, and far off, the hollow knock of boats against the dock marked the start of the fishing day.

The tide advanced in tranquil cycles, rounding polished stones with foam. Each retreat left a mosaic of gleaming shells and amber seaweed that breathed and sank under the next wave. On the sand, warmth was still only a promise; a single step revealed the rising moisture, leaving shimmering footprints that vanished in seconds.

Between two leaning palms—whose leaves rustled in harmony with the wind—a hammock swayed, its threads faded by sun and salt. In it, a bronzed man in an open shirt and dark glasses rested with the ease of one who has watched for years without interfering. Beside him, a broken guitar and a half-empty bottle of rum and cola dripped into the sand. The sea mist curled his hair, giving his skin a nacreous sheen. He had no name. Or at least, he didn’t remember one.

In the distance, a young man walked the exact line where sea kissed land. His bare feet sank only briefly before the next wave erased his steps. Premature white hair. An alert gaze that tracked every glint of water. He walked tall, but now and then clutched the metal pendant on his chest, as if seeking an anchor—or a reason. Since childhood, he’d dreamed of burning towers and torn wings, of swords that sang in a forgotten tongue. He woke with his heart racing and a name whispered between the beats:
Michael.

The man in the hammock watched him approach. A flicker of recognition—or maybe just amusement—crossed his half-smile. He didn’t bother to rise; he raised his glass, and the ice clinked softly like distant underwater bells.

"Well, well…" he murmured, as if savoring the words. "Who’d have thought you’d end up here."

The young man stopped, surprised by a voice alien to the monotony of waves. His eyes searched the face behind the sunglasses for a trace of familiarity, but found only a playful gleam that seemed to invite him to a game whose board he had yet to see.

"I suppose it’s time to get back in the game."

The sky flickered. A gull cried in the distance…
**The End.**
