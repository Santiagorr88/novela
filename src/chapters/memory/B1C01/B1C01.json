  "summary": "The sand of Serephis ground under his armored boots with a sound like shattering glass. It glittered, a desert of shattered obsidian and splintered light stretching to an impossible horizon. The air was thin, smelling of ozone and the static that precedes a lightning strike. Miguel drew it deep into his lungs, a measured breath that did nothing to calm the storm within. This place was honest in its hostility, a purity of malice he almost preferred to the gilded lies of a council chamber. He almost preferred the clarity of this desolation. His hand, sheathed in a silver gauntlet, went to his hip, fingers curling around the phantom grip of a weapon he felt he *should* possess, a familiar weight he instinctively sought. It was the gesture of a soldier, a commander far from his legion, an old habit that died harder than faith.",
