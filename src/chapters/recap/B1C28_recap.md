## Focus: What Happened

The narrative describes the climax of an apocalyptic battle between Heaven’s forces, led by the archangel Michael, and Hell’s legions, commanded by Belial. The angels fight not for victory but to buy Michael time to find a definitive solution to the conflict. During the confrontation, Michael is killed by Belial, who wields a mysterious, ancient spear. Michael’s death causes him to disintegrate and his sword to be lost, forcing the angels into a strategic retreat. Decades later, Michael is reincarnated on Earth as a young man with no memories, observed by an enigmatic figure who seems to have been waiting for him.
