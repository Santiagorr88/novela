# Recap â€“ B1C02

## What happened?
*   Miguel, still in the chaotic desert of Serephis, is confronted by his brother, Gabriel, who coalesces from ambient light and sound.
*   Gabriel conveys the Council's deep concern that Miguel's solitary quest is a demonic deception and that his presence is desperately needed on the front lines due to the war going poorly (e.g., breach at Seraphiel Overlook, Seventh Legion broken).
*   Gabriel attempts to appeal to Miguel's sense of duty and their shared past, reminding him of their victory at the Obsidian Gates.
*   Miguel tries to explain his internal "hollowness" and "missing note" to Gabriel.
*   Gabriel probes Miguel's aura, recoiling from the conceptual wound in Miguel's chest, sensing a profound void.
*   Gabriel, setting aside formal duty, pleads with Miguel to "come home."
*   Miguel's conceptual wound pulses, overriding his wavering resolve.
*   Miguel refuses Gabriel's plea, stating he "cannot" return.
*   Gabriel warns Miguel that the Council will view this as a betrayal and that he cannot protect him.
*   Gabriel dissolves back into light, leaving Miguel alone in Serephis.
*   Miguel, now resolute in his solitude, continues his journey.

## Which characters appeared?
*   **Miguel:** (Returning) The protagonist, deeply conflicted by a vow and a conceptual wound, feeling isolated and burdened, ultimately choosing his personal quest over duty and brotherly love.
*   **Gabriel:** (Newly introduced) Archangel of the Divine Voice, Miguel's brother and oldest friend, acting as a messenger for the Council and making a desperate personal plea to Miguel. He shows deep concern and sorrow for his brother.

## What themes or mysteries were explored?
*   **Existential Void/Conceptual Wound:** Miguel's internal "hollowness" is reinforced as his primary, undeniable motivation. Gabriel's physical recoil from it highlights its alien and unsettling nature.
*   **Love vs. Duty:** The central conflict, as Gabriel's brotherly love and duty to the Celestial Host clash with Miguel's personal imperative driven by his wound.
*   **Deception/Madness:** The Council's (and Gabriel's initial) fear that Miguel's quest is a demonic deception or a sign of his mind being compromised is introduced.
*   **The Nature of Serephis:** Reinforced as a chaotic, abrasive, and discordant realm, physically repelled by Gabriel's pure harmony.
*   **Heaven's Structure & War Status:** The existence of the Council and the dire state of the war (Seraphiel Overlook, Seventh Legion, Camael holding the line) are revealed, raising the stakes for Heaven.
*   **Foreshadowing of Uriel's Accusations:** Gabriel's omission of Uriel's "venomous accusations" hints at a more aggressive stance from Uriel against Miguel.

## What decisions were made?
*   **Miguel decides to prioritize his personal quest:** He explicitly tells Gabriel he "cannot" return, choosing the path dictated by his conceptual wound over his duty to Heaven and his brother's emotional appeal.
*   **Gabriel decides to deliver the Council's warning and make a personal plea:** He acts as both a formal emissary and a concerned brother, attempting to persuade Miguel.
*   **Gabriel decides to leave Miguel to his chosen path:** After Miguel's refusal, Gabriel departs, acknowledging his inability to protect Miguel from the Council's inevitable judgment.
