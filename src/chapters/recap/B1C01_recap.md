### Chapter Summary: B1C01 – The Tree Outside Time

#### What Happened

The chapter opens with a prologue in the ash plains of Gehena, where the angelic captain **Sariel** takes part in a brutal battle against demonic hordes. During the clash, he witnesses a young angel named **Elion** suffer the “Final Death” at the hands of the demon **Ronove**. Instead of being utterly destroyed, Elion’s essence is sent to Earth to reincarnate as a human without memory—a fate that deeply affects Sariel, who realizes the war doesn’t just claim lives; it also births forgetting.

The main story follows **Michael**, the Supreme Commander of Heaven, as he travels through the timeless desert of Serephis. He’s weighed down not by a physical wound, but by a profound **emptiness of purpose** and the burden of an eternal war. He’s guided by a mysterious “heartbeat” that only he can sense. **Gabriel** intercepts him, urging him to return to the front lines where **Uriel** needs him, but Michael refuses, believing the heartbeat may lead to a way to end the war—not just continue it.

Michael reaches an impossible clearing with twelve ivory trees and a silver ash at the center. Embedded in the tree, he finds **Solmire**, a blade of living light. Upon touching it, he receives a vision of an enigmatic, playful artisan forging the weapon with chaotic joy. When he draws the sword, its power echoes through the realms, felt by **Uriel** on the battlefield, **Lucifer** in Hell, and a mysterious **herbalist elder** on Earth. The sword fills Michael’s emptiness with burning purpose. As he departs, a drop of crystallized sap from the tree adheres to his armor.

#### Characters Introduced

* **Michael**: Supreme Commander of Heaven. Burdened by the war, seeking a purpose that could lead to an end. Main protagonist of the chapter.
* **Gabriel**: Archangel of the Voice. Acts as the voice of reason and the Conclave’s concerns, but ultimately trusts Michael’s decision.
* **Sariel**: Angelic captain. Serves as the POV in the prologue to illustrate the soul-cost of war.
* **Lucifer**: Infernal Prince. The main antagonist, intrigued by Solmire’s awakening.
* **Uriel**: Archangel of Celestial Fire. Mentioned by Gabriel, shown reacting to Solmire’s power surge.
* **Ronove**: Demonic captain. A formidable enemy who delivers Elion’s fatal blow.
* **Elion**: A young angel whose death and reincarnation illustrate one of the universe’s key metaphysical mechanics.
* **The Herbalist Elder**: A nameless, mysterious figure on Earth who senses Solmire’s power—implying a hidden nature or forgotten past.

#### Themes and Mysteries Explored

* **The spiritual cost of war**: The central theme is the emotional toll and loss of purpose (*Michael’s void*) in an eternal conflict, beyond physical wounds.
* **Reincarnation of souls**: Introduces the idea that fallen angels reincarnate as humans with no memory, adding tragedy and complexity to the war.
* **The mystery of Solmire**: The sword is a living artifact of immense power. Its origins are obscure, symbolized by the “mischievous-eyed artisan” in Michael’s vision.
* **Forgotten or dormant powers**: The herbalist’s reaction and Lucifer’s recognition suggest that Solmire belongs to a pre-war age of power whose actors and rules may have been forgotten.
* **Purpose vs. Duty**: Michael faces the dilemma of choosing duty (returning to the front) or hope (pursuing Solmire), potentially changing everything.
* **The Tree’s Tear**: The drop of crystallized sap clinging to Michael is a minor mystery, whispering “nameless names” he cannot yet understand.

#### Key Decisions

1. **Michael chooses to defy the Conclave**: He follows the mysterious “heartbeat” instead of obeying the summons to war, betting on a path that could end the conflict.
2. **Gabriel chooses to trust Michael**: Despite doubts and pressure from the Conclave, he allows Michael to continue his journey and pledges to hold the line in his absence.
3. **Michael chooses to take Solmire**: By drawing the blade, he consciously accepts its power, purpose, and pact—committing himself to a path that may reshape the war’s future.
