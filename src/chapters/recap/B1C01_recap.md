# Recap â€“ B1C01

## What happened?
*   Miguel, Supreme Commander of the Celestial Host, marches across the desert plane of Serephis, driven by a "hollow ache" and a mysterious, directional "summons" in his chest.
*   His brother, Gabriel, Archangel of the Divine Voice, arrives to express the Council's concern that Miguel's pursuit is a demonic deception, pleading for him to return to the Celestial Bastion.
*   Miguel refuses Gabriel's plea, asserting that the call is a more fundamental command he must follow, and continues his solitary journey.
*   He reaches the Grove Without Shadow, an unnaturally perfect place, where he finds a sword of living light, Solmire, plunged into a great ash tree.
*   Upon touching the sword's hilt, Miguel is cast into a cosmic vision of a primordial forge, where creation is chaotic and amoral, dominated by the "jubilant, irreverent, and terrifying" laughter of an unseen maker. He realizes the blade was forged for "anarchic fun," not divine purpose.
*   Miguel draws Solmire, which fills the void in his chest with a cold, final power, leaving him "complete, yet hollowed out." The ash tree groans, and the grove's light dims.
*   A silent, powerful pulse radiates from Miguel, felt across creation.
*   In Hell, Lucifer senses this pulse, recognizes the "laughter" within it, and expresses intellectual curiosity.

## Which characters appeared?
*   **Miguel:** (Protagonist, returning) Supreme Commander of the Celestial Host, driven by an internal void and a mysterious call. Shows weariness, pain, resolve, and a profound transformation after drawing the sword.
*   **Gabriel:** (Returning) Archangel and Miguel's brother, expresses deep concern for Miguel and the Celestial Host, pleading for his return. Shows love, worry, and grief.
*   **Lucifer:** (Antagonist, returning) Infernal Prince Absolute, senses the cosmic pulse and recognizes its ancient, irreverent nature, showing intrigue.
*   **Ereloth (implied):** The "unseen maker" of Solmire, whose "jubilant, irreverent, and terrifying" laughter is experienced by Miguel in a vision, hinting at the sword's true, chaotic origin.

## What themes or mysteries were explored?
*   **Existential Void and Incompletion:** Miguel's driving pain and the central mystery of "What was taken from me?"
*   **Duty vs. Inner Imperative:** Miguel's choice to follow a personal, mysterious call over his divine duty and the Council's concerns.
*   **Nature of Divine Authority:** The call Miguel follows is "terrifyingly different" from the Divine Word, hinting at powers and truths predating established celestial law.
*   **Foreshadowing of Solmire's True Nature:** The sword is revealed not as a holy relic, but as a product of "anarchic fun" and a "cosmic joke," tied to an unseen, amoral creator.
*   **Ancient Powers and Pre-Judgment Era:** Lucifer's recognition of the "old songs" and "laughter" suggests a history and forces older than the current Heaven-Hell conflict.
