# Recap – B1C01

## What happened?
*   Miguel, Supreme Commander of the Celestial Host, marches across the desert plane of Serephis, driven by a "hollow ache" and a mysterious, directional "summons" in his chest.
*   His brother, Gabriel, Archangel of the Divine Voice, arrives to express the Council's concern that Miguel's pursuit is a demonic deception, pleading for him to return to the Celestial Bastion.
*   Miguel refuses Gabriel's plea, asserting that the call is a more fundamental command he must follow, and continues his solitary journey.
*   He reaches the Grove Without Shadow, an unnaturally perfect place, where he finds a sword of living light, Solmire, plunged into a great ash tree.
*   Upon touching the sword's hilt, Miguel is cast into a cosmic vision of a primordial forge, where creation is chaotic and amoral, dominated by the "jubilant, irreverent, and terrifying" laughter of an unseen maker. He realizes the blade was forged for "anarchic fun," not divine purpose.
*   Miguel draws Solmire, which fills the void in his chest with a cold, final power, leaving him "complete, yet hollowed out." The ash tree groans, and the grove's light dims.
*   A silent, powerful pulse radiates from Miguel, felt across creation.
*   In Hell, Lucifer senses this pulse, recognizes the "laughter" within it, and expresses intellectual curiosity.

## Which characters appeared?
*   **Miguel:** (Protagonist, returning) Supreme Commander of the Celestial Host, driven by an internal void and a mysterious call. Shows weariness, pain, resolve, and a profound transformation after drawing the sword.
*   **Gabriel:** (Returning) Archangel and Miguel's brother, expresses deep concern for Miguel and the Celestial Host, pleading for his return. Shows love, worry, and grief.
*   **Lucifer:** (Antagonist, returning) Infernal Prince Absolute, senses the cosmic pulse and recognizes its ancient, irreverent nature, showing intrigue.
*   **Ereloth (implied):** The "unseen maker" of Solmire, whose "jubilant, irreverent, and terrifying" laughter is experienced by Miguel in a vision, hinting at the sword's true, chaotic origin.

## What themes or mysteries were explored?
*   **Existential Void and Incompletion:** Miguel's driving pain and the central mystery of "What was taken from me?"
*   **Duty vs. Inner Imperative:** Miguel's choice to follow a personal, mysterious call over his divine duty and the Council's concerns.
*   **Nature of Divine Authority:** The call Miguel follows is "terrifyingly different" from the Divine Word, hinting at powers and truths predating established celestial law.
*   **Foreshadowing of Solmire's True Nature:** The sword is revealed not as a holy relic, but as a product of "anarchic fun" and a "cosmic joke," tied to an unseen, amoral creator.
*   **Ancient Powers and Pre-Judgment Era:** Lucifer's recognition of the "old songs" and "laughter" suggests a history and forces older than the current Heaven-Hell conflict.
*   **Transformation and Loss of Self:** Miguel's fear of becoming an "extension of the blade" is realized as he becomes "complete, yet hollowed out" after drawing Solmire.

## What decisions were made?
*   **Miguel decides to follow the mysterious "pull"** in his chest, prioritizing it over his military discipline and the Council's concerns.
*   **Miguel refuses Gabriel's plea to return to the Celestial Bastion**, choosing to pursue the truth of his internal summons alone.

# Recap – B1C02

## What happened?
*   Miguel crosses from the Serephis wastes into a mysterious grove, marked by an abrupt change in environment, from scorching desert to cool, still air and emerald moss.
*   The grove exhibits unnatural properties: metallic-sheen trees that generate their own light without casting shadows, and a profound, oppressive silence that absorbs all sound.
*   Miguel experiences spiritual vertigo as the grove's physics defy reality.
*   A path of compressed moss appears before him, leading deeper into the grove, and the path behind him vanishes, forcing him forward.
*   He reaches a clearing where a colossal ash tree stands, at its heart a blade of liquid starlight, which is the source of the grove's light and the intense summons Miguel has been following.
*   The blade promises to fill the hollow ache in his chest, but Miguel senses it would replace his identity rather than truly heal him.
*   After recoiling from this realization, Miguel resolves to approach the blade, choosing to face its truth rather than remain broken.
*   He raises his hand, hovering inches from the hilt of the blade.

## Which characters appeared?
*   **Miguel:** (Returning) The protagonist, experiencing profound weariness, suspicion, awe, spiritual vertigo, loneliness, desperate yearning, cold dread, and a final, grim resolve.
*   **Gabriel:** (Mentioned) His voice echoes in Miguel's mind, warning that the destination might be a "ruse."

## What themes or mysteries were explored?
*   **The Grove Without Shadow:** Introduced as a new, metaphysically impossible location where fundamental laws of physics (like light and shadow) are altered, hinting at a reality beyond conventional understanding.
*   **The Summons and the Hollow Ache:** Reinforced as Miguel's primary, compelling motivation, now intensifying into a clear, high-frequency resonance.
*   **The Celestial Blade:** Introduced as a blade of "contained, liquid starlight," described as alien to Heaven's understanding, older than the war, and perfectly resonating with Miguel's spiritual wound. This foreshadows its primordial origin.
*   **Nature of Healing vs. Replacement:** A core mystery is introduced regarding the blade's promise of wholeness. Miguel fears it would consume or replace his identity, rather than truly mend his spirit, raising questions about the true cost of power and completeness.
*   **Deception vs. Truth:** Gabriel's warning of a "ruse" is reinforced, contrasting with Miguel's internal feeling that the summons is "divine." The grove's unnerving perfection feels like a deception, yet its laws are undeniably real.
*   **Loneliness and Erasure:** The oppressive stillness of the grove makes Miguel feel erased and profoundly alone, deepening the theme of his isolation.

## What decisions were made?
*   **Miguel decides to enter the grove:** Despite his deep suspicion and Gabriel's warning, the powerful summons in his chest compels him to cross the threshold.
*   **Miguel decides to follow the path:** After a moment of hesitation and realizing retreat is impossible, he surrenders to the grove's guidance, moving deeper into its heart.
*   **Miguel decides to approach the blade:** After initially recoiling from the blade's predatory promise, he chooses to walk towards it, seeking a "final answer" to his brokenness, whatever the cost.
