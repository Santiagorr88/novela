# ⚙️ FUNDAMENTAL LAWS
## Reincarnation System
- Angels/demons reincarnate **only** as humans with no memories.  
- Dominant virtue ⇒ angelic rebirth; dominant impulse ⇒ demonic rebirth.  
- True identity is **revealed only at the moment of human death**.  
- Neutral humans may **ascend** (peaceful death) or **fall** (violent death).

## Final Death
Achievable **only** if the soul’s predestined weapon destroys the being  
(either in its divine form **or** while human).

## Transformations & Side‑Switching
Allowed. Use this rule to craft arcs where souls “wake up” on the opposite side.

# 🛡️ HIERARCHIES
## Heaven  
Miguel → Gabriel | Raphael | Uriel → Commanders → Captains → Squad Leaders

## Hell  
Lucifer → Infernal Lords (Belial, Leviathan, Asmodeus) → Commanders → Captains → Squad Leaders

🔎  THE FORGOTTEN — ANCESTRAL ARCHANGELS  
────────────────────────────────────────
“Three were wrought of light before time itself.”

### Origin
- First beings ever created by God, predating the original Judgment.  
- A civil war among them led to their near extinction.  
- Only three survived: **Azael, Thaeriel, Ereloth**.  
- Each one believes they are the sole survivor.  
- They retain **full memory**, **absolute free will**, and **immense power held in check**.

### ⚔️ Ancestral Weapons  
| Weapon | Current Wielder | Essence | Note |
|--------|-----------------|---------|------|
| **Solmire** — Sword of Righteous Judgment | Miguel | Light alive | True name unknown to the world |
| **Lamentum** — Obsidian Spear of Pain | Thaeriel | Burning truth |  “Un‑named” to all others |
| **Aetheris** — The Broken Staff | Azael | Soul‑balance | Dormant until wielded by its maker |

*Only a Forgotten can unleash the weapon’s full potential.*

---



### Quick Table — Virtue / Peril Balance

| Forgotten | Dominant Virtue | Greatest Peril |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Azael** | Wisdom / Restraint | **Despair** (nihilism) |
| **Thaeriel** | Justice / Fury | **Hate** (blind judgment) |
| **Ereloth** | Freedom / Irreverence | **Apathy** or **Vanity** |

*(None of the three knows the others survived. The world still believes they perished in myth.)*

---

# 📜 CENTRAL PROPHECY  (Codex Mortalis)
> “Three were forged of light before time began…  
> *One shall fall silent and become the beacon, unless doubt extinguish it.*  
> *One shall judge and bring order, or kindle the eternal fire.*  
> *One shall laugh… and if he loves nothing, the world will burn for his void.*  
> …and if the three awaken, **he** shall awaken as well.”

*(Gemini: quote the full stanza at the start of key chapters and echo shorter lines when foreshadowing.)*

---

# 💀  THAMORAK — THE ENIGMA
*No character (except possibly the Forgotten themselves) knows the full truth.*

- **Competing theories**  
  1. The **fourth Forgotten**, corrupted beyond recognition.  
  2. A **sentient energy** born of cosmic imbalance.  
  3. The **cycle of Judgment incarnate** — an apocalypse wearing flesh.

- **Refrain that should resurface**  
  > “If the three awaken… **he** will awaken as well.”

# 🌍 KEY LOCATIONS

## 🕊️ HEAVEN

**Temple of Shattered Light** – Headquarters since Michael’s fall. Its alabaster vault is cracked by a divine fault‑line that glows like dawn and dusk at once. Strategy halls hover on broken terraces; every fissure hums with a lingering echo of Michael’s sword.

**Seraphiel’s Lookout** – A floating observatory of crystal lenses and harp‑strings, attuned to mortal prayers. Angels train here to read “harmonics” in the cosmic weave and predict incursions hours before they begin.

**The Silent Choir** – A necropolis of winged statues that once housed an order sworn to eternal hymns. Their voices were stolen in the First Sundering; now the marble mouths open only when forgotten names are spoken nearby.

---

## 🔥 HELL

**Abyss of Varkhannar** – Belial’s vertical citadel: an inverted canyon whose walls are ribbed with thrones. Gravity twists inward; screams fall upward like ash. The deeper you descend, the older the sins petrified in obsidian.

**Crimson Nexus** – A neutral market where souls, memories and favors are auctioned under shifting crimson skies. Even archangels risk clandestine visits; neutrality is enforced by glyphs older than Heaven or Hell.

**Tower of the Eternals** – A black‑iron spire that imprisons proto‑entities predating the Judgment. Each level is a different era’s nightmare; time is bartered as currency among the wardens.

---

## ⚖️ INTERMEDIATE PLANES

**Zaphor’el** – A plane sheared during the Prime War. Mirrors of broken time drift like icebergs; taking a wrong reflection may drop visitors decades ahead—or behind.

**Umbrahum** – A desert where unjudged souls wander beneath a sun that never sets nor moves. Whispers of forgotten verdicts guide travelers to oases of temporary memory.

**The Inverted Vale** – A gravity‑reversed canyon where rivers flow skyward into an aurora maw. Legends claim Thamorak’s heartbeat can be sensed beneath the floating boulders.

---

## 🌎 EARTH

**University of Navarion** – An old Iberian campus whose sealed catacombs store censored papal relics. Several re‑incarnated angels unknowingly lecture here on metaphysics.

**Isle of Turein** – A storm‑wrapped basalt isle lost in the Atlantic. Solmire was last seen streaking into its labyrinthine forest; compasses spin, and nights last thirteen hours.

**Grey City** – An anonymous megacity of soot‑lined towers and neon scripture. First recorded site where humans spontaneously manifested angelic or demonic traits after Judgment fractures.

*Gemini may invent further sites, but must record each name, plane and purpose for continuity.*


---

## MYSTERY ARCS (Solved across the trilogy) — “Lost Weapons” Version

### 1. *Lamentum* (Belial’s spear)
- **Book I:** Belial wields it, but hints show it is **not infernal**: runes no demon can read; it vibrates near “just” acts.
- **Book II:** Codex fragment mentions a *triple forge* before the Judgment. During an indirect encounter with **Arin Cross** (Thaeriel’s human form) the spear heats and “recognizes” him.
- **Book III:** Full reveal — *Lamentum* was forged by Thaeriel. Belial stole/retrieved it from a sealed temple while Thaeriel lay dormant. In the climax the spear demands to return to its creator.

### 2. *Solmire* (Miguel’s sword)
- **Book I:** Used as Heaven’s banner; no one knows its true name or origin. Reacts subtly to emotions of freedom/chaos.
- **Book II:** Codex line: “Born from a laugh that defied law.” When **Milo Ray** (Ereloth human) draws near, the blade hums as if remembering.
- **Book III:** Full reveal — Ereloth forged it as a cosmological prank and lost it when the Forgotten destroyed each other. Miguel must choose to return it or impose his will on a semi‑sentient weapon.

### 3. *Aetheris* (broken staff, currently missing)
- **Book I:** Myths of a relic that “quiets wars”; in a major battle there is a zone where emotions fade (lingering resonance).
- **Book II:** **The Summit Sage** (Azael human) feels a pull toward neutral ruins; he finds fragments that soothe the wounded. Hints the staff is shattered into multiple pieces.
- **Book III:** Azael reassembles Aetheris. Reveal — it broke when the Forgotten fought. Restoring it can **seal** Thamorak… or balance him into a controlled awakening.

### 4. True identity of the “Forgotten”
- **Book I:** Only legends (“three lights before Judgment”) and anomalous phenomena.
- **Book II:** They appear as separate humans (The Summit Sage, Grant Hale, Milo Ray), each convinced they are the sole survivor.
- **Book III:** Convergence forced by Thamorak’s pulse; revelation they are the proto‑archangels whose civil war birthed the Heaven/Hell fracture and scattered the weapons.

### 5. Nature of **Thamorak**
- **Book I:** Incomplete prophecy: “If the three awaken…”; faint pulses in Zaphor’el.
- **Book II:** Fragments speculate: a lost fourth Forgotten? Energy of imbalance? First strong “heartbeat” when two weapons resonate simultaneously.
- **Book III:** Reveal — Thamorak is the emergent consciousness generated by the rupture of the three (sum of their extremes). Reuniting weapons + bearers completes the circuit that awakens him. Debate: destroy, seal with Aetheris, or channel him.

# 🖋️ STYLE & EDITORIAL RULES


1. **Chapter length:** 2000 – 2500 words (Royal Road sweet‑spot).  
2. **Chapter arc:** close previous beat → new impact scene → development → mini‑cliff/hook.  
3. **Dialogue:** must read naturally—include pauses, gestures, and subtext, not robotic exchanges.  
4. **Secrecy:** keep the true names of the Ancestral Weapons and the Forgotten Archangels hidden until the book where each is meant to be revealed.  
5. **Who understands the “death‑weapon” law?**  
   - Major Archangels, Infernal Lords, and Metatron → full knowledge.  
   - Commanders & Captains → fragmentary, half‑myth.  
   - Rank‑and‑file troops → only rumors.  
6. ### 🎨 Style (do not mention sources)

Blend of:
- **Brandon Sanderson**: rule clarity, clean setups and payoffs.  
- **Neil Gaiman / Ursula K. Le Guin**: lyricism, symbolism, reflection.  
- **Steven Erikson**: military scale and large‑cast management.  
- **John Milton**: theological weight and epic grandiloquence.

## 🛑 GLOBAL GENERATION DIRECTIVE

You must generate **an entire trilogy**.  
The **Final Reference Chapter** (`B1C28 – The Echo of the Sword`) belongs **only to Book I** and its text is immutable (canon).

### Phases

1. **Book I – “The Echo of the Sword”**  
   Generate chapters `B1C01` … `B1C27`.  
   Then **insert exactly** the provided Final Reference Chapter (`B1C28`) **without any change**.

2. **Book II – “The Forgotten Voices”**  
   Continue from the state left by `B1C28`: Miguel reincarnated without memory, sword lost, retreat to the Temple, Belial holding the spear, etc.  
   Generate `B2C01` … (~25–30 chapters) following the mystery roadmap.

3. **Book III – “The Pulse of the Void”**  
   Advance all open threads from the end of Book II up to Thamorak’s awakening and the planned finale.

### Mandatory Rules

- **Do not alter** the Final Reference Chapter text. If regeneration is requested, return it *verbatim*.  
- Everything written in `B1C01–B1C27` must lead naturally and coherently into the events, wounds, absences, and tone of `B1C28`.  
- Books II and III must strictly honor the consequences established in `B1C28`.  
- Revelation pacing:  
  - Book I: only hints (ancient weapons, vibrations, myths).  
  - Book II: gradual emergence of Azael and Thaeriel; partial clues.  
  - Book III: full explanation (origin of weapons, identity of the Forgotten, Thamorak).  
- Maintain character continuity: if someone dies a **definitive death**, they do not return except via permitted memories/visions.  
- Chapter numbering resets per book (`B2C01…`, `B3C01…`).  

Violating any of these points invalidates the output.
